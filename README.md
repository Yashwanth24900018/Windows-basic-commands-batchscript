## AIM:
To execute Windows basic commands and batch scripting

## DESIGN STEPS:
## Step 1:
Navigate to any Windows environment installed on the system or installed inside a virtual environment like virtual box/vmware

## Step 2:
Write the Windows commands / batch file . Save each script in a file with a .bat extension. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform the operations. Adapt paths as needed based on your system configuration.

## Step 3:
Execute the necessary commands/batch file for the desired output.

Create a batch file on the desktop that checks whether a user-input number is odd or not. The script should: Prompt the user to enter a number. Calculate the remainder when the number is divided by 2. Display whether the number is odd or not. Ask the user if they want to check another number. Repeat the process if the user enters Y, and exit with a thank-you message if the user enters N. Handle invalid inputs for the continuation prompt (Y/N) gracefully.

Write a batch script to check whether a file named sample.txt exists in the current directory. If the file exists, display the message sample.txt exists. Otherwise, display sample.txt does not exist. Pause the script at the end to view the result.

Instructions: Use the IF EXIST conditional statement. Make sure the script works for files located in the same directory as the batch file. Use pause to keep the command window open after displaying the message. Expected Output (if the file exists):
